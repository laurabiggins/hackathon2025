# Notes around Isoquant

IsoQuant is a tool for the genome-based analysis of long RNA reads, such as PacBio or Oxford Nanopores. IsoQuant allows to reconstruct and quantify transcript models with high precision and decent recall. If the reference annotation is given, IsoQuant also assigns reads to the annotated isoforms based on their intron and exon structure. IsoQuant further performs annotated gene, isoform, exon and intron quantification.
